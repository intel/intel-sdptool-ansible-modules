3) Writing Ansible Script:
    1. Ansible Configuration (ansible.cfg):
        a. Intro:
            ansible.cfg file is used to modify ansible pre-configuration such

        b. Sample ansible.cfg file
        -----------------------------------
        [defaults]
        INTERPRETER_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python3
        transport = local
        forks = 1000
        [persistent_connection]
        command_timeout = 3000
        -----------------------------------
    2. Inventory definition (hosts):
        a. Intro:
            hosts file, also known as inventory, defines the set or group of
            targets where the tasks defined in playbook are executed. In this
            plugin, the host is defined with BMC ip, BMC username and
            BMC password.
        b. Host variable:
            bmc_username: BMC username
            bmc_password: BMC password
            ini_path: syscfg file path for set_biosconfig_all
            vmedia_iso_path: iso path for vmedia
                I. Samba share path with username and password
                II. ISO or IMG file path
            sup_path: SUP directory path for update, command - update
            custom_sup_path: SUP directory path for custom_deploy, command - custom_deploy
            cup_path: CUP zip path for cup_deploy and cup_inspect, command - cup_deploy, cup_inspect

    3. Playbook (test.yaml):
        a. Intro:
            Playbook file consists of collection of tasks that are executed
            on set or group of hosts. 
        b. SDPPlugin task Example:
        -----------------------------------
        - name: System Information
          sdptool:
             action: "systeminfo"
          register: output
        -----------------------------------

4) Execution:
    * cd into directory having ansible.cfg, hosts and playbook files
    * Run below command to initiate ansible tasks
        ansible-playbook -i hosts test.yaml


Note: 
    1.  Host reboot is avoided by the plugin for set_biosconfig and set_biosconfig_all
    2.  ipmi reboot commands such as getini, getbiosoptions, setoptions, setlan and
        deployoptions are not supported
